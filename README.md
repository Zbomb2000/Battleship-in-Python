# Battleship-in-Python
I am trying to make the classic game "Battleship" in Python coding language!
I have already made a mini version of Battleship, but I want the code to be more simple.
Someone else has already done this, but their version was confusing. This version is more simple.
You don't have to contribute to this, this is just a fun side-project, but I would appriciate it if you did because I could then use this code to make more advanced programs.

--PROBLEMS--
Code has way too many "if" and "elif" statements. There should be a way to make a function that could solve this.
The game is only a 3 by 3 grid. The original Battleship game has a 10 by 10 grid. I think this grid should be bigger.
The bot that you play against sometimes attacks the same grid point twice. I can't find out how to fix this.
I don't know how to make full ships. I can only make one grid point at a time.

--STUFF THAT SHOULD BE ADDED--
Two player mode - This should be added to make the game more like the original
Choose grid size - Depending on how long the player wants the game to last, they could choose the grid size
Bot difficulty modes - I think that there should be an 'EASY' mode and a 'HARD' mode for the bot. EASY mode would let the bot attack the same grid point multiple times.
Quickplay mode - A small grid and a fast player vs bot game.

--If you do contribute to this, thank you in advance! This code could be taken and used to make even more advanced programs!
